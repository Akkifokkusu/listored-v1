# listored-v1
#### List-keeping webapp written in (pretty bad) PHP &amp; JS

This is the code that (currently) powers [listored.com](http://www.listored.com).

I decided to open-source this version of the app today (2015-03-07) because I've grown a lot as a developer recently and realized that I have no interest in maintaining the relatively-terrible codebase that I started a few years ago when I was first getting into web development.

That said, I feel like the code should live on for posterity and perusal. If anyone wants to fork it and continue hacking on it, more power to them. There are some things I wanted to do that I never had the time/motivation to accomplish, and some other things that I was able to do and are probably good ideas but were implemented very amateurishly.

If you've happened to stumble upon this somehow and have any questions or want some help, you can find me [@akkifokkusu](https://www.twitter.com/akkifokkusu).
